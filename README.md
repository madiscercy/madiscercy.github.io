# React Portfolio

This is a portfolio website built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Description

This website is a showcase of my professional portfolio. It includes sections such as:

- **Home:** A brief introduction about myself.
- **Portfolio:** Displays some of the projects I've worked on, including images and links to deployment.
- **Resume:** Where you can view and download my resume.
- **Contact:** A form you can fill out to get in touch with me.

The website also features a fixed navigation bar at the top of the screen and a footer at the bottom, both of which stay in place as you navigate through the website.

## Usage

To use the website, simply navigate to the deployed link [(https://madiscercy.github.io/)](https://madiscercy.github.io/React-Portfolio-20/). From there, you can click on the navigation links to move through the different sections of the website.
